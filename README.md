## CasperPets

_As discussed on [Episode 196 of the Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/196)._


A quick script created to scrape co-sleeping stats from the [Casper website](http://casper.com).

It was used to create [this tweet](https://twitter.com/barelyknown/status/526345482009067520):

```
Stats from @casper reviews:

Sleeps…156
with pet…84…54%
with dog…61…39%
with cat…34…22%
with both…9…6%

```


I doubt that the code works anymore, but it might be interesting to look at.
